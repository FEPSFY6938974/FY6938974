 This article is an overview of several prevalent arguments against the theory of mathematical Platonism introduced by notable philosophers in the area - Paul Benacerraf and Hartry Field. In the paper "What Numbers Could Not Be", Benacerraf challenges the idea of 
natural numbers being set-reducible, suggesting they are not unique abstract objects as viewed by Platonism. His later work "Mathematical Truth" presented the epistemological objection, questioning how our minds are able to obtain mathematical knowledge. As the 
argument faced criticism for its foundation on the causal theory of knowledge, Field shifted the focus towards the reliability challenge in his book "Science Without Numbers"; Field attempted to reformulate scientific theories without the use of mathematics, to 
demonstrate it providing no knowledge of the physical world, suggesting it is only a useful tool.

  Mathematical Platonism is a metaphysical theory rooted in Plato's philosophical ideas, which claims mathematics is independent of the human mind and language (1)*. Numbers and sets are considered to be existing abstract entities, not affected by space and time;
Platonism asserts that mathematicians are not inventing new concepts, and are instead discovering the already existing truths.
 Paul Benacerraf was a philosopher in the field of mathematics, best known for his arguments against mathematical Platonism, introduced in the two papers "What Numbers Could Not Be" in 1965 (2)*, and "Mathematical Truth" in 1973 (3)*. Benacerraf denied the 
possibility of gaining knowledge assuming Platonism to be true, and argued in favour of structuralism - the view that mathematics are governed by the relationships between objects, instead of the objects themselves; mathematical objects are considered to be
positions within an abstract structure. In "What Numbers Could Not Be", Benacerraf presents the problem of identification, challenging the idea that numbers are unique abstract objects. It points out that there are infinite ways of identifying natural numbers with
sets, specifically, utilising the Zermelo (4)* set theory method in contrast with von Neumann's (5)*. For example:
  
Number 3 using Zermelo ordinals:
<img src="3.png" alt ="3" width ="350" height ="150">

Number 3 using von Neumann ordinals:
<img src="1.png" alt ="1" width ="350" height ="150">

 According to Platonism, a number has to be identified with a specific set, which would render all other identifications incorrect. However, both of the number 3 definitions function equally well, and there are no laws to judge which is the correct one. Since this
contradiction demonstrates we are unable to choose the true definition, Benacerraf concludes that numbers can be better understood as what they represent in relation to each other, instead of unique objects with intrinsic values.
 Aside from the problem of identification, Benacerraf proposes an epistemological objection in "Mathematical Truth"(3)*, suggesting our mathematical theories cannot be considered reliable knowledge, if we assume Platonism to be true. His reasoning relies on the
causal theory of knowledge developed by Goldman in 1967 (6)*, which asserts that one can only have knowledge of a fact if the said fact has directly or indirectly caused their belief about the fact. According to the argument, if we take a Platonist stance, then
we possess knowledge of the abstract mathematical concepts. Then, if we have knowledge of these concepts, we must have a causal relationship with them. However, we lack a suitable method for drawing that connection between our minds and the abstract concepts;
following this premise, Benacerraf concludes we cannot have reliable mathematical knowledge, opposing the Platonist claim.
 A popular criticism of the epistemological problem was rejecting the need for causal connection between knowledge and its knower, entertaining the possibility of mathematical intuition. Building on Gödel's mathematical realism (7)*, one can argue that the human
minds can understand the said abstract truths similarly to understanding logical truths, as our rational insight extends to the reality they exist in. If logical intuition is considered reliable, then it follows that mathematical intuition is too, as they are
the same mental abilities applied to different content. While intuition is recognised to yield errors, it can be refined with reasoning and empirical evidence, leading to overall successful results. Consequently, there is no requirement to interact with mathematical
truths to have knowledge of them.
 Another notable philosopher, Hartry Field, attempted to reformulate Benacerraf's argument, presenting the reliability challenge in his work "Science Without Numbers" (8)*. Assuming abstract mathematical objects cannot interact with us, they would lack the capacity
to influence our minds. The problem lies in the lack of explanation as to why the majority of our mathematical beliefs appear to correlate with the truths that are unable to guide these discoveries. Human perception wouldn't extend to the abstract numbers and sets,
and they cannot correct our reasoning, therefore we cannot navigate towards the correct beliefs. Correspondingly, any existing correlation is then a product of pure coincidence.
 Field's solution to the given problem is nominalism, the philosophical view contrasting Platonism with its denial of abstract mathematical objects, stating only concrete, physical things exist. Field claimed science does not require mathematics, and although useful,
physical facts can be derived without it. He attempts to show this through nominalising physics, in particular, Newton's law of universal gravitation (8)*, which asserts the force of attraction between particles in the universe is proportional to the product of their
masses and inversely proportional to the squared difference between their centers (9)*. In his reconstruction, Field eliminates the use of functions and mathematical objects by replacing them with relationships between physical entities. He describes the strength at
which objects attract one another relative to each other, without utilising numbers, leading to the conclusion that equations can be swapped for comparisons and rules about the patterns of physical quantities. Therefore, as the success of scientific theories can be
explained without the existence of abstract mathematical objects, mathematics is considered to be a useful and more efficient tool for formulating scientific laws, nevertheless not a source of new physical knowledge.
